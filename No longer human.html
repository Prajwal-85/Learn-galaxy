      <h1>No Longer Human</h1>
      <p class="author">— by Osamu Dazai | reflection & life summary</p>
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
      <p>
        <strong>No Longer Human</strong> is not just a story — it’s a quiet confession.  
        It speaks of a man who loses his place in the world, who wears smiles to hide his fear of people,  
        and who slowly drifts away from what it means to be *human*.  
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “I thought I could live pretending, but even that pretense eventually turned against me.”
      </blockquote>

      <div class="key-points">
        <div class="point">
          <h3>The Mask of Laughter</h3>
          <p>Dazai’s protagonist laughs not out of joy, but fear — the fear of being exposed, of being unwanted.  
          Many hide behind smiles that are really silent screams.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>Alienation from Humanity</h3>
          <p>He sees himself as less than human, unable to connect or love in a world that demands masks and performance.  
          The loneliness isn’t outer — it’s inside his very identity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>Decay of Self</h3>
          <p>His life becomes a slow disappearance. Every wrong turn — alcohol, lies, silence —  
          pulls him further from who he once wanted to be.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>Society’s Mirror</h3>
          <p>Dazai forces us to ask: is the problem the man, or the world that demands he must always pretend?  
          Maybe both — and that’s what makes the story haunting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>Beauty in Collapse</h3>
          <p>There is a strange beauty in ruin.  
          The honesty of a soul that can’t pretend anymore — it’s dark, but it’s real.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Think about:</strong>
        <ol style="margin-top:8px; margin-left:18px; color:#cfe6ff;">
          <li>What makes someone “human”? Is it morality, empathy, or just survival?</li>
          <li>Why do people wear masks — and what happens when they fall off?</li>
          <li>Can solitude heal, or does it sometimes destroy?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="tips">
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> Write one paragraph about the last time you felt disconnected from others — what did you learn from it?
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes, the saddest stories help us understand ourselves more than happy ones.
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Thought:</strong> Strength isn’t pretending to be fine.  
          It’s quietly accepting your broken pieces and still trying to move.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:16px; color:#cfe6ff;">
        <strong>Final thought:</strong>  
        <em>No Longer Human</em> leaves us hollow — not because it’s hopeless, but because it’s honest.  
        It whispers what many feel but never say: that sometimes, to be human is to be lost —  
        and to survive that loss is its own kind of courage.

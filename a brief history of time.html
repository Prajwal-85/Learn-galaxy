      <i>A Brief History of Time</i> takes us on a journey through the universe ‚Äî from the Big Bang to black holes. 
      Written by the legendary physicist <b>Stephen Hawking</b>, this book helps ordinary readers understand extraordinary concepts: 
      time, space, gravity, and the mystery of creation itself.

    <h2>The Universe Has a Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      Hawking explains how time and space began with the <b>Big Bang</b>. There was no ‚Äúbefore‚Äù ‚Äî time itself started at that moment. 
      This changes how we see existence: the universe didn‚Äôt just appear; it evolved from nothing, governed by laws that we can study and understand.
    </p>

    <h2>Black Holes ‚Äî The Edge of Reality</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most powerful ideas in the book is that black holes aren‚Äôt just cosmic traps ‚Äî they might also leak information in the form of radiation, now known as 
      <b>Hawking Radiation</b>. Even in complete darkness, the universe whispers secrets through physics.
    </p>

    <h2>The Power of Curiosity</h2>
    <p>
      Hawking teaches us that curiosity is the greatest force. You don‚Äôt have to be a scientist to wonder how the stars were born ‚Äî 
      curiosity is what connects every human to the universe. His message: <b>‚ÄúLook up at the stars, not down at your feet.‚Äù</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Key Lessons from the Book</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The universe has laws ‚Äî and we can understand them.</li>
      <li>Time began with the Big Bang ‚Äî not before it.</li>
      <li>Even black holes aren‚Äôt truly black ‚Äî they emit light.</li>
      <li>Imagination is as important as knowledge.</li>
      <li>Curiosity and perseverance can break any limit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Hawking‚Äôs story is not just scientific ‚Äî it‚Äôs human. Despite being trapped in a wheelchair, he unlocked the secrets of time. 
      His life proves that even when your body is limited, your mind can travel across galaxies.

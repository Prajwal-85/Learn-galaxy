      <h1>Metamorphosis</h1>
      <p class="author">— by Franz Kafka | meaning, themes & reflection</p>
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
      <p>
        <strong>Metamorphosis</strong> is one of the most haunting works ever written.  
        Kafka begins with a nightmare — a man wakes up to find himself transformed into something monstrous.  
        Yet what truly breaks him isn’t the transformation — it’s the reaction of those he loved.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2 style="margin-top:12px; color:#dbe9ff;">Themes & deep reflections</h2>

      <div class="key-points">
        <div class="point">
          <h3>Transformation as Truth</h3>
          <p>Gregor’s physical change mirrors what he already was inside — tired, invisible, dehumanized by endless work.  
          The insect is not a curse; it’s honesty made visible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>Isolation & Rejection</h3>
          <p>Once transformed, Gregor’s family hides him, disgusted and ashamed.  
          It shows how easily love fades when usefulness disappears.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>The Weight of Responsibility</h3>
          <p>All his life, Gregor worked for others — parents, sister, job.  
          When he finally cannot serve, he is seen not as human, but as burden.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>Loss of Voice</h3>
          <p>He tries to speak, but only strange sounds come out.  
          Kafka turns this into a symbol of every person whose truth is unheard — those who scream silently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
          <h3>The Quiet Death</h3>
          <p>Gregor’s end is not dramatic. It’s quiet. Forgotten.  
          A reminder that sometimes the world moves on before we do.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <a class="btn secondary" href="index.html">Back to Learn Galaxy</a>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Think about:</strong>
        <ol style="margin-top:8px; margin-left:18px; color:#cfe6ff;">
          <li>Have you ever felt invisible even when surrounded by people?</li>
          <li>What defines your worth — your soul, or your ability to be useful?</li>
          <li>Is transformation freedom, or punishment?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="tips">
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> Write a letter to your “old self” — the one who changed silently without anyone noticing.
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Kafka doesn’t describe the insect clearly — because the monster was never physical. It was how others saw him.
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Thought:</strong> Transformation often begins the moment the world stops understanding you.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:16px; color:#cfe6ff;">
        <strong>Final thought:</strong>  
        <em>Metamorphosis</em> is not about turning into an insect — it’s about turning into truth.  
        About how fragile love becomes when appearance and purpose fade.  
        It reminds us that being seen, truly seen, is one of the rarest forms of being alive.

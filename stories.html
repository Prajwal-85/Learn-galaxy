      <h2>The Mirror That Forgot Me</h2>
      <p class="author">by Prajwal Khutekar</p>
      <p>
        In a small room with no windows, Arin sat facing the mirror that hung crookedly on the cracked wall. He’d stared into it every night for years — not because he liked his reflection, but because he didn’t trust it.
        <br><br>
        The mirror didn’t always show what was real. Some nights it smiled when he didn’t. Some nights its eyes moved slower than his own. He had stopped telling people long ago — they’d just call him tired, paranoid, broken.
        <br><br>
        Last night, however, something changed. The reflection didn’t move at all. It just stood there, staring. Arin waved his hand — nothing. He smiled — nothing. The reflection’s face was blank, but there was a faint shimmer in its pupils, like something behind the glass was watching through him.
        <br><br>
        “Who are you?” Arin whispered.
        <br><br>
        The reflection blinked once. Its lips parted slightly, and in a voice colder than his own breath, it said:
        <br><b>“You stopped being me a long time ago.”</b>
        <br><br>
        The next morning, the room was clean, the mirror perfectly straight. On the other side, Arin smiled — from inside the mirror.
        <br><br>
        He looked at the body outside, now motionless on the floor, and whispered:
        <br><b>“I finally remember who I am.”</b>

      <h2>The Stars Remember Her Name</h2>
      <p class="author">by Eddy Reigns</p>
      <p>
        Every night, Rian climbed to the rooftop to talk to the stars. Not because he believed they could hear him — but because they once did.
        <br><br>
        She used to sit beside him there, wrapped in an old blanket, whispering stories about constellations. She’d name them like friends — “That one’s Orion, the lonely hunter. That one’s Lyra, who sings even when no one listens.”
        <br><br>
        Now the blanket lay folded beside him. Her laughter was only an echo in his memory. But the stars still shone, unchanged — as if they remembered.
        <br><br>
        “Do you still see her?” he asked one night, voice trembling.
        <br><br>
        A shooting star crossed the sky — a silent streak of fire fading into the dark.
        <br><br>
        He smiled faintly. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
        <br><br>
        He closed his eyes and whispered the words she’d once said to him:
        <br><b>“When people die, the universe doesn’t take them away. It just hides them in the light.”</b>
        <br><br>
        Years later, when Rian was gone, a child found his rooftop notebook. On the last page, there was a drawing of two constellations — Orion and Lyra — holding hands. Beneath it, one sentence:
        <br><b>“I finally found her in the sky.”</b>

      <h2>Good or Evil</h2>
      <p class="author">by Prajwal Khutekar</p>
      <p>
        What was there to live for me? Voices in my head, screams of humans echoing loudly. Was the pain good for me or bad? Did God really exist — then why didn’t He come to save me?
        <br><br>
        I was lost in the darkness, chasing the distant light that never stayed. I never reached that light. Why? I was burning in the darkness, dying, suffering. Did I want to die? Why do humans fear death? Do humans live only because they don’t want to die?
        <br><br>
        That day, I fell in love with the darkness. I escaped everything — pain, suffering, happiness. But for me, it was nothing... only silence.

      <h2>Is This All True</h2>
      <p class="author">by Prajwal Khutekar</p>
      <p>
        She was born in a small village full of green — rivers, mountains, small houses, and the laughter of happy people.
        <br><br>
        One day, a troop of soldiers came. They started killing everyone. Their leader felt nothing. She ran and ran with her family as their village burned behind them. Everything was gone — looted, destroyed.
        <br><br>
        Later, a man appeared. He was alone, a warrior hiding his true identity. He saw a family sleeping under a tree. As they woke up, fear filled their eyes.
        <br><br>
        “Don’t kill us,” they pleaded.
        <br><br>
        The warrior’s eyes were calm. “This was all a test,” he said, “to see how the human mind works.”
        <br><br>
        Suddenly — she woke up. It was a dream. Or was it?
        <br><br>
        She saw the same man standing in front of her. They talked for five minutes... and then he vanished.
        <br><br>
        Was it an experiment? Was the dream true? Or was she still dreaming?
